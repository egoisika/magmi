This is Magmi, the Magento Mass Importer, by dweeves

----

*To get the unmodified svn trunk mirror, switch to the master branch.*

Magmi is a standalone, external application, that directly interfaces with your Magento Database.  
If used incorrectly it *will* munch your data. Work with Database backups. Just to clarify (from the authors wiki),

    USE THIS PROJECT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

    DO NOT APPLY IT ON PRODUCTION UNTIL THOUROUGHLY TESTED ON A SAMPLE SITE.
    IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU DO WITH MAGMI YOU BETTER ASK FOR A PROFESSIONAL'S HELP.

For documentation and examples, read the wiki at
http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/magmi/
